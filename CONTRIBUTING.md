## Filing an issue

If you encounter an issue or have a feature request, you can [open an issue](https://github.com/urholaukkarinen/transform-gizmo/issues/new/choose) for it.

Before opening an issue, check that there is not already a similar issue created by someone else.

## Opening a pull request

For things such as tiny bug fixes or version bumps, feel free to open a pull request without creating an issue first.

For larger changes, please file an issue first.

Keep pull requests focused. Avoid including multiple unrelated changes in the same pull request.
